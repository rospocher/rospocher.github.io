	abstract = {We present an approach for ontology population from natural language English texts that extracts RDF triples according to FrameBase, a Semantic Web ontology derived from FrameNet. Processing is decoupled in two independently-tunable phases. First, text is processed by several NLP tasks, including Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), whose results are integrated in an RDF graph of mentions, i.e., snippets of text denoting some entity/fact. Then, the mention graph is processed with SPARQL-like rules using a specifically created mapping resource from NomBank/PropBank/FrameNet annotations to FrameBase concepts, producing a knowledge graph whose content is linked to DBpedia and organized around semantic frames, i.e., prototypical descriptions of events and situations. A single RDF/OWL representation is used where each triple is related to the mentions/tools it comes from. We implemented the approach in PIKES, an open source tool that combines two complementary SRL systems and provides a working online demo. We evaluated PIKES on a manually annotated gold standard, assessing precision/recall in (i) populating FrameBase ontology, and (ii) extracting semantic frames modeled after standard predicate models, for comparison with state-of-the-art tools for the Semantic Web. We also evaluated (iii) sampled precision and execution times on a large corpus of 110 K Wikipedia-like pages.},
